### React

# Introduction
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed and maintained by Facebook, React has gained widespread adoption in the web development community for its simplicity, performance, and component-based architecture. It's particularly well-suited for creating single-page applications where user interfaces can be dynamic and responsive.
